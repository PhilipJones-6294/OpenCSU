# OpenCSU: Computational Modeling of Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/OpenCSU/blob/main/clinical_dashboard.ipynb)

**OpenCSU** is an open-source "Digital Twin" framework for modeling skin pathologies. It unifies the Seirin-Lee (2023) Histamine model with a Bradykinin Angioedema model to simulate refractory hives.

## Features
* **Unified Physics Engine:** Solves 6 coupled Reaction-Diffusion PDEs on GPU.
* **Patient Specifics:** Models Pharmacokinetics based on Age, Weight, and Organ Function.
* **Safety First:** Includes real-time Drug-Drug Interaction checking (e.g., CYP450 inhibition).
